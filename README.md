# Belly Button Biodiversity
This is Flask app I created using Python 3 (libraries: os, pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, flask). It has several API routs from which I pull data to create visualization. Data stored in SQLite and plots created with JavaScript and Plotly.js library. Also I sed HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create this dashboard. 
Project deployed to Heroku and can be accessed via this link: https://bellybutton-germs.herokuapp.com/

To run locally on computer: download repositury, run "python app.py" in command line in root repository (make sure all libraries are installed) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
